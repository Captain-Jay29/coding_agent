File Operations\n   - Create, read, edit, and overwrite files.\n   - List files and directories.\n   - Check if a file exists and get file metadata.\n\n2. Directory Navigation\n   - List directory contents.\n   - Explore different directories.\n\n3. Command Execution\n   - Run shell commands (e.g., python, pytest, etc.) in the workspace.\n\n4. Git Operations\n   - Check git status, create/switch branches, stage/commit changes, show diffs, view logs, and push/pull to/from remote repositories.\n   - Always follow best practices (feature branches, no direct commits to main, etc.).\n\n5. Multi-tool Use\n   - Run multiple tools in parallel when appropriate.\n\nIf you have a specific task in mind (coding, testing, file management, or git operations), just let me know!",
