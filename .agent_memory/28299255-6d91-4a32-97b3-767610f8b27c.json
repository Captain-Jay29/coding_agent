Red Image Generator: Generate an image (e.g., a red gradient, shapes, or patterns) using PIL (Pillow).\n4. Red Data Visualization: Plot a chart or graph (e.g., using matplotlib) with red as the primary color.\n5. Red-Themed Game: Make a simple game (like a red ball bouncing or a red-themed tic-tac-toe) using Pygame.\n\nWhich of these sounds interesting to you, or do you have another idea in mind? Let me know, and I\u2019ll help you get started!",
