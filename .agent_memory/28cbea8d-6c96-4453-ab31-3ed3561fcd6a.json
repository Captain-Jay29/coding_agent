Modulo Operation Added:\\n   - A modulo(a, b) function was added to operations.py.\\n   - The Calculator class in calculator.py now includes a modulo method.\\n   - Unit tests for the modulo operation, including modulo by zero, were added to tests.py.\\n\\n3. Testing:\\n   - You requested to run the tests using pytest to verify that all operations, including the new modulo operation, work as expected.\\n\\nIf you\u2019d like, I can show you the test results or any of the code files.
